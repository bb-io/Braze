This workflow triggers whenever a campaign is updated in Braze. It automatically
downloads the campaign message, creates a translation job in Phrase TMS, waits
for the job to complete, pulls down the translated content, uploads the
localized campaign back into Braze, and finally sends a Slack notification
confirming that the translated campaign is live.
